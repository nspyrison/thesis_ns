\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}

This is where you introduce the main ideas of your thesis, and an
overview of the context and background.

In a PhD, Chapter 2 would normally contain a literature review.
Typically, Chapters 3--5 would contain your own contributions. Think of
each of these as potential papers to be submitted to journals. Finally,
Chapter 6 provides some concluding remarks, discussion, ideas for future
research, and so on. Appendixes can contain additional material that
don't fit into any chapters, but that you want to put on record. For
example, additional tables, output, etc.

\section{Touring}\label{sec:tour}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview}

In univariate datasets histograms, or smoothed density curves are
employed to visualize data. In bivariate data scatterplots and contour
plots (2-d density) can be employed. In three dimensions the two most
common techniques are: 2-d scatter plot with the 3rd variable as an
aesthetic (such as, color, size, height, \(etc.\)) or rendering the data
in a 3-d volume using some perceptive cues giving information describing
the seeming depth of the image
\footnote{Graphs of data depicting 3 dimension are typically printed on paper, or rendered on a 2-d monitor, they are intrinsically 2-d images. They are sometimes referred to as 2.5-d, or more frequently erroneously referred to as 3-d, more on this later.}.
When there are 4 variables: 3 variables as spatial-dimensions and a 4th
as aesthetic, or a scatterplot matrix consisting of 4 histograms, and 6
unique combinations of bivariate scatterplots.

Let \(p\) be the number of numeric variables; how do we visualize data
for even modest values of \(p\) (say 6 or 12)? It's far too common that
visualizing in data-space is dropped altogether in favor of modeling
parameter-space, model-space, or worse, long tables of statistics
without visuals\autocite{wickham_visualizing_2015}. Yet, we all know of
the risks and possible mis-leadingness of relying too heavily on
parameters alone\autocites{anscombe_graphs_1973}{matejka_same_2017}. So
why do we move away from visualizing in data-space? Scalability, in a
word, we are not familiar with methods that allow us to concisely depict
and digest \(p \geq 5\) or so dimensions. This is where dimensonality
reduction comes in. Specifically, we will be focusing on touring. In the
interest of time I will not belabor a taxonomy of dimentionality
reduction here, see \autocite[ REDU]{DIM} for a treaties. Using the wide
range of touring techniques we are able to preserve the visualization of
data-space, and the intrinsic understanding of structure and the data,
beyond looking at statistic values alone.

Touring is a linear dimensonality reduction technique that orthagonally
projects \(p\)-space down to \(d\)-space. Many of these projections are
interpolated while varying the rotation of \(p\)-space and viewed in
order to the effect of watching an animation of the lower dimensional
embedding changing as \(p\)-space is manipulated. Shadow puppets offer a
useful analogy to aid in conceptualizing touring. Imagine a fixed light
source facing a wall. When a hand or puppet is introduced the
3-dimensional object projects a 2-dimensional shadow onto the wall. This
is a physical representation of a simple projection, that from \(p=3\)
down to \(d=2\). If the object rotates then the shadow correspondingly
changes. Observers watching only the shadow are functionally watching a
2-dimensional tour as the 3-dimensional object is manipulated.

\subsection{History}\label{history}

Touring was first introduced by Asimov in 1985 with his purposed Grand
Tour\autocite{asimov_grand_1985} at Stanford University. In which,
Asimov suggested three types of Grand Tours: torus, at-random, and
random-walk. The specifics of which will be discussed below in the
Typology section.

Note that the the above methods have no input from the user aside from
the starting basis. The bulk of touring development has largely been
around dynamic display, user interaction, geometric representation, and
application.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of software implementing touring in some
degree, ordered by descending year:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Spinifex \autocite{spinifex} -- for Linux, Unix, and Windows.
\item
  Tourr \autocite{wickham_tourr_2011} -- for Linux, Unix, and Windows. R
  package.
\item
  CyrstalVision \autocite{wegman_visual_2003} -- for Windows.
\item
  GGobi \autocite{swayne_ggobi:_2003} -- for Linux and Windows.
\item
  DAVIS \autocite{huh_davis:_2002} -- Java based, with GUI.
\item
  VRGobi \autocite{nelson_xgobi_1998} -- for use with the C2 in
  steroscopic 3d displays.
\item
  ExplorN \autocite{carr_explorn:_1996} -- for SGI Unix.
\item
  XGobi \autocite{swayne_xgobi:_1991} -- for Linux, Unix, and Windows
  (via emulation).
\item
  XLispStat \autocite{tierney_lisp-stat:_1990} -- for Unix, and Windows.
\item
  Prim-9 \autocites{asimov_grand_1985}{fisherkeller_prim-9:_1974} -- on
  an internal operating system.
\end{itemize}

Support and maintenance of such implementations give them a particularly
short life span, while conceptual abscraction and technically heavier
implementations have hampered user growth. There have been notable
efforts to deminish the barriers to entry and make touring more
approachable as a data exploration tool {[}\textcite{huh_davis:_2002};
\textcite{swayne_ggobi:_2003}; \textcite{wegman_visual_2003};
\textcite{wickham_tourr_2011}; huang\_tourrgui:\_2012{]}.

\subsection{Typology}\label{typology}

\subsubsection{Movement}\label{movement}

A fundamental aspect of touring is the path of rotation. Of which there
are four primary distinctions\autocite{buja_computational_2005}: random
choice, precomputed choice, data driven, and manual control.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Grand tour}, random choice such as Asimov's grand
  tour\autocite{asimov_grand_1985}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    torus-surface
  \item
    Geodesic constrained
  \item
    at-random
  \item
    random-walk
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Precomputed choice, In which the path has already been generated or
  defined

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    little tour \autocite{mcdonald_interactive_1982}, where every
    permutation of variables is stepped through in order, analogous to a
    brute-force or exhaustive search.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Data driven - a guided tour performing (stochastic) gradient descent
  on some objective function{[}\textcite{hurley_analyzing_1990}; {]}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    correlation
  \item
    holes
  \item
    cmass
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Manual control, a constrained rotation on selected manipulation
  variable and magnitude\autocite{cook_manual_1997}.
\item
  \emph{dependance tour}; wouldn't this be data driven? why does tourr
  distinguish?
\end{itemize}

\ldots{} * torus: where a \(p\)-dimensional torus, \(T^p\) is created
from a Cartesian product of \(p\) unit circles with
\(T^p \in \mathbb{R}^p\). Unfortunately uniformity of the parameters do
not correlate to uniform points on the surface of the torus. If step
distance between frames is fixed, disproportionate time is spent between
subspaces. If step distance is change to account for uniform points on
the torus then the continuity of the tour is lost.\\
* at-random: where each 2-frame is chosen at random without replacement.
This affords an assured uniform distribution of subspaces, but is far to
discontinuous for observation. It also leaves no parameters to control.
* random-walk: combines the continuity of the torus method and the
uniformity of the at-random method while leaving room for a control
parameter.

\subsubsection{Geoms}\label{geoms}

Scatterplots offer a simple, general case for viewing lower-dimension
embeddings of higher-dimensions. Such visualization offer \(p\)-dim down
to \(d\)-dim, typically two in the case of a standard monitor. Yet, no
intrinsic value stops touring being used in other graphics or geoms
(geometrics). For instance using parallel coordinate plots
(PCP)\autocite{ocagne_coordonnees_1885}, Andrews plots
\autocite{andrews_plots_1972}, Chernoff faces
\autocite{chernoff_use_1973}, anaglyphs \autocite{rollmann_zwei_1853},
star glyphs \autocite{siegel_surgical_1972}, scatterplot matrix
\autocite{chambers_graphical_1983}, and even pictures all offer
perfectly valid graphs in \(p\)-dimensions.

This works well when the number of dimensions being toured is small (in
the neighborhood of 5-10), yet the number of view, or 2-frames and we
can produce from \(p\)-space suffers from the so called blessing/curse
of dimensionality. In which the plethora of degrees of freedom either
offer many (non-unique) solutions to a problem or something that becomes
ever increasing unlikely, \(ie.\) a bivariate square needs .

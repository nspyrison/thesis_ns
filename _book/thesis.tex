\section{Touring}\label{sec:tour}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview}

In univariate datasets histograms, or smoothed density curves are
employed to visualize data. In bivariate data scatterplots and contour
plots (2-d density) can be employed. In three dimensions the two most
common techniques are: 2-d scatter plot with the 3rd variable as an
aesthetic (such as, color, size, height, \(etc.\)) or rendering the data
in a 3-d volume using some perceptive cues giving information describing
the seeming depth of the image
\footnote{Graphs of data depicting 3 dimension are typically printed on paper, or rendered on a 2-d monitor, they are intrinsically 2-d images. They are sometimes referred to as 2.5-d, or more frequently erroneously referred to as 3-d, more on this later.}.
When there are 4 variables: 3 variables as spatial-dimensions and a 4th
as aesthetic, or a scatterplot matrix consisting of 4 histograms, and 6
unique combinations of bivariate scatterplots.

Let \(p\) be the number of numeric variables; how do we visualize data
for even modest values of \(p\) (say 6 or 12)? It's far too common that
visualizing in data-space is dropped altogether in favor of modeling
parameter-space, model-space, or worse: long tables of statistics
without visuals \autocite{wickham_visualizing_2015}. Yet, we all know of
the risks inherant in relying too heavily on parameters alone
\autocites{anscombe_graphs_1973}{matejka_same_2017}. So why do we move
away from visualizing in data-space? Scalability, in a word, we are not
familiar with methods that allow us to concisely depict and digest
\(p \geq 5\) or so dimensions. This is where dimensonality reduction
comes in. Specifically, we will be focusing on a specific group called
touring. In the interest of time I will not belabor the diversity of
dimentionality reduction, (see
{[}\textcite{grinstein_high-dimensional_2002};
\textcite{carreira-perpinan_review_1997}; heer\_tour\_2010{]} for a
quick summary). Suffice it to say that touring has a couple of salient
features: linear transfromations such that we can interpolate back to
the oiginal variable space and does not discard dimensions, something
that is common to other linear techniques. By emploring the bredth of
tours we are able to preserve the visualization of data-space, and with
it, the intrinsic understanding of structure and distribution of data
that is more susinct or beyond the reach of statistic valules alone.

Touring is a linear dimensonality reduction technique that orthagonally
projects \(p\)-space down to \(d(\leq p)\) dimensions. Many such
projections are interpolated, each making local rotations in
\(p\)-space. These frames are then viewed in order to the effect of
watching an animation of the lower dimensional embedding changing as
\(p\)-space is manipulated. Shadow puppets offer a useful analogy to aid
in conceptualizing touring. Imagine a fixed light source facing a wall.
When a hand or puppet is introduced the 3-dimensional object projects a
2-dimensional shadow onto the wall. This is a physical representation of
a simple projection, that from \(p=3\) down to \(d=2\). If the object
rotates then the shadow correspondingly changes. Observers watching only
the shadow are functionally watching a 2-dimensional tour as the
3-dimensional object is manipulated.

\subsubsection{Terminology}\label{terminology}

n, p (sometimes called d by Wegman, or n ), d (sometimes called k by
wegman, or d in tourr)

\subsection{History}\label{history}

Touring was first introduced by Asimov in 1985 with his purposed Grand
Tour\autocite{asimov_grand_1985} at Stanford University. In which,
Asimov suggested three types of Grand Tours: torus, at-random, and
random-walk. The specifics of which will be discussed below in the
Typology section.

TALK ABOUT maths Here::

Note that the the above methods have no input from the user aside from
the starting basis. The bulk of touring development since has largely
been around dynamic display, user interaction, geometric representation,
and application.

This works well when the number of dimensions being toured is small (in
the neighborhood of 5-10), yet the number of view, or 2-frames and we
can produce from \(p\)-space suffers from the so called blessing/curse
of dimensionality. In which the plethora of degrees of freedom either
offer many (non-unique) solutions to a problem or something that becomes
ever increasing unlikely,

\subsection{Tour path}\label{tour-path}

A fundamental aspect of touring is the path of rotation. Of which there
are four primary distinctions\autocite{buja_computational_2005}: random
choice, precomputed choice, data driven, and manual control.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{grand tour}, a constrained random choice p-space. Paths are
  constrained for changes in direction small enough to maintain
  continuity and allow for user comphrehension

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    torus-surface \autocite{asimov_grand_1985}
  \item
    Geodesic
  \item
    at-random
  \item
    random-walk
  \item
    \emph{local tour}, a sort of grand tour on leash, such that it goes
    to a nearby random projection before returning to the original
    position and iterating
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{guided tour}, data driven tour optimiazing some objective
  function via (stochastic) gradient descent
  \autocite{hurley_analyzing_1990}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    holes \autocite{cook_projection_1993} - iterates projections that
    add more white space to the center of the projection.
  \item
    cmass \autocite{cook_projection_1993} - find the projection with the
    most density or mass in the center.
  \item
    lda \autocite{lee_projection_2005} - linear discrimin ant analysis,
    seeks a projection where 2 or more classes are most separated.
  \item
    pda - pricipal component analysis finding where the data is most
    spread (1d only).
  \item
    other user-defined objective function \autocite{wickham_tourr_2011}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{planned tour}, Precomputed choice, In which the path has already
  been generated or defined.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{little tour} \autocite{mcdonald_interactive_1982}, where every
    permutation of variables is stepped through in order, analogous to a
    brute-force or exhaustive search.
  \item
    a saved path of any other tour
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{manual tour} - Manual control, a constrained rotation on
  selected manipulation variable and
  magnitude\autocite{cook_manual_1997}. Typically used to explore the
  local area after identifying an interesting feature from another tour.
\item
  \emph{dependance tour}, combination of \(n\) independent 1d tours. A
  vector describes the axis each variable will be displayed on.
  \textbf{ie} \(c(1, 1, 2, 2)\) is a 4 to 2d tour with the first 2
  variables on on the first axis, and the remaining on the second.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{correlation tour} \autocite{buja_data_1987}, a special case of
    the dependance tour, analogous to canonical correlation analysis
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Geometrics and display
dimension}\label{geometrics-and-display-dimension}

Up to this point we have been talking about 2d scatterplots, which offer
the first and a simple case for viewing lower-dimensional embeddings of
\(p\)-space. However, other geometrics (or geoms) offer perfectly valid
orthonormal projections as well.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  1d geoms

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    1-d densities: such as histogram, average shifted
    histograms\autocite{scott85}, and kernal density\autocite{scott95}.
  \item
    image: \autocite[ 2001]{Wegman}
  \item
    time series: where multivariate values are independantly lagged to
    view peak and trough allignment. Currently no package
    implementation, but use case is discussed in
    \autocite{cook_manual_1997}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  2d geoms

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    2-d density \autocite[ GITHUB]{NS}
  \item
    scatterplot
  \item
  \end{itemize}
\item
  2.5d, 3d geoms \{ADD FOOTNOTE ABOUT 2.5d vs 3d\}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Anaglyphs, sometimes called stero, where (typically) red images are
    positioned for the left channel and cyan for the right, when viewed
    with corresponding filter glasses give the depth perception of the
    image.
  \item
    Depth, which use some subset of depth cues, most commonly size
    and/or color of data points.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \(d\)-dim geoms

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Andrews crurves \autocite{andrews_plots_1972}, smoothed variant of
    parallel coordinate plots, discussed below.
  \item
    Chernoff faces \autocite{chernoff_use_1973}, variables linked to
    size of facial features for rapid cursory like-ness comparison of
    observations.
  \item
    Parallel coordinate plots \autocite{ocagne_coordonnees_1885}, where
    any number of variables are ploted in parallel with observations
    linked to their cooresponding variable value by polylines.
  \item
    Scatterplot matrix \autocite{becker_brushing_1987}, showing a
    triangle matrix of bivariate scatterplots with 1-d density on the
    diagonal.
  \item
    Radial glyphs, radial variants of parallel coordinates including
    radar, spider, and star glyphs \autocite{siegel_surgical_1972}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Aplication}\label{aplication}

Below is a non-exhaustive list of software implementing touring in some
degree, ordered by descending year:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Spinifex \autocite{spinifex} -- for Linux, Unix, and Windows.
\item
  Tourr \autocite{wickham_tourr_2011} -- for Linux, Unix, and Windows. R
  package.
\item
  CyrstalVision \autocite{wegman_visual_2003} -- for Windows.
\item
  GGobi \autocite{swayne_ggobi:_2003} -- for Linux and Windows.
\item
  DAVIS \autocite{huh_davis:_2002} -- Java based, with GUI.
\item
  VRGobi \autocite{nelson_xgobi_1998} -- for use with the C2 in
  steroscopic 3d displays.
\item
  ExplorN \autocite{carr_explorn:_1996} -- for SGI Unix.
\item
  XGobi \autocite{swayne_xgobi:_1991} -- for Linux, Unix, and Windows
  (via emulation).
\item
  XLispStat \autocite{tierney_lisp-stat:_1990} -- for Unix, and Windows.
\item
  Prim-9 \autocites{asimov_grand_1985}{fisherkeller_prim-9:_1974} -- on
  an internal operating system.
\end{itemize}

Support and maintenance of such implementations give them a particularly
short life span, while conceptual abscraction and technically heavier
implementations have hampered user growth. There have been notable
efforts to deminish the barriers to entry and make touring more
approachable as a data exploration tool {[}\textcite{huh_davis:_2002};
\textcite{swayne_ggobi:_2003}; \textcite{wegman_visual_2003};
\textcite{wickham_tourr_2011}; huang\_tourrgui:\_2012{]}.

display}{spinifex: extending tourr with manual tours and graphic display}}\label{ch:spinifex}

\section{Abstract}\label{abstract-1}

Touring teqniques offer a great opertunity for data-space vizualization
of (\(p > 3\)) multivariate data sets. This paper discusses the \emph{R}
package \emph{spinifex}, which adds support for the manual tour, which
is particularly usefuly for exploring the local structure after
identifying a feature of interest, perhaps via guided tour.
Additionally, \emph{spinifex} extends graphic outputs to \emph{plotly}
and \emph{gganimation}. This work extends the functionality of and is
compatible with \emph{tourr}.

Keywords: grand tour, projection pursuit, manual tour, tourr, touring,
high dimenson visualization, hihg dim vis, dimensionality reduction,
visualization, statistical graphics, data-space.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Both classical and contemorary visualizations of data are presented in
two dimensions, that of a computer monitor or in print. How is it that
we come to view and share data that exsists in \(p > 3\) dimensions? In
an appeal to brievity we shall ignore model and parameter summarization
due to there shortcomings
\autocites{anscombe_graphs_1973}{matejka_same_2017}. Within the realm of
data-space visualization we are left with projecting higher volumes and
embedding them within lower dimensional spaces that we can vizualize.

This is not a new phenomena, such linear projections have been in use
for quite some time. \autocites{PCA}{LDA-FISCHer1936} and the myriad of
single value deconcomposistion (SVD) techniques from numerous
disciplines use such embeddings. Previous application look at data in
one (or few) static orientations, after some objective optimization. For
instance in PCA, we reorient \(p\)-dimensions such that we have a
reference to the ordered components that describe a descending ammount
of variation held within the data. Yet we still have \(p\) components
remaining to visualize. Where does the dimension reduction come in? From
plotting only the first two or three and potenially another dimension
tied to data point asthetic. This is maximizes the ammount of variation
that can be display in an emedding, but regually discards a large
proportion of the variation held within the data.

More recently non-linear dimensionality techniques have become popular,
such as t-distributed stchocastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)
\autocite{maaten_visualizing_2008}, building off of sammon mappings
\autocite{sammon_nonlinear_1969}. Such non-linear methods make for
astounding distinction when in low \(d\) embeddings, but contain
inhearant shortcomings. Namely: that the non-linear tranformations break
inter-operability back to the original data-space, and that they can
suffer from overfitting. If there is no inherent clustering with the
data, it's posible that noise within the variables may become the
proment feature and be displayed erroneously as group clustering.

\autocites{asimov_grand_1985}{buja_grand_1986} suggested grand tours in
which random walks in \(p\)-space can be interpolated and embedded in
\(d\) dimensions which are then viewed in sequence. The broader scope of
touring has some beneficial features, namely: touring keeps the original
dimensionality in tact unlike tradition static linear-projections, and
maintains inter-operabilty in the orginal dimensions, a primary drawback
of non-linear dimensionality reduction.

TODO: clean up above, talk about what

\section{Terminology and demystifying
projection:}\label{terminology-and-demystifying-projection}

Suppose that we have tri-variate data, \(\textbf{X}_{[8,~3]}\), the
corners points of a rectanguloid. We can describe the relative
orientation by defining

For every \(p\)-dimensional space can be described by the direction and
magnitude of axes in a square matrix that we call a basis. Imgine 3 axes
of an XYZ Caresian volume (\emph{ie.} a basis \(\in \mathbb{R}^p\)). In
matimatical form we would write this as a diagonal identity matrix of
demension 3.

\begin{verbatim}
##   X Y Z
## X 1 0 0
## Y 0 1 0
## Z 0 0 1
\end{verbatim}

This basis has some nice properties that are mathimatically nice to
preserve, namely, that each axis as is at a right angle to the other
(\emph{orthagonal}), and are unit \emph{normal} (length or norm equal to
one). If matrix meets both of these criteria we call it
\emph{orthonormal}.

\section{Manual tour}\label{manual-tour}

Let's explore the process behind the manual tour

Given:

\begin{description}
  \item[$\textbf{X}_{[n,~p]}$] A dataset contaning $n$ observations of $p$ numeric variables. 
  \item[$\textbf{B}_{[p,~d]}$] An orthonormal \footnote{Where each variable is both: orthagonal, at right angles (dot product is 0) to the other variabels, and unit vectors, a norm = 1} basis describing the current orientation projecting $p$ down to $d$ dimension.
\end{description}

\begin{align*}
  \textbf{X}_{[n,~p]} ~=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    X_{1,~1} & \dots  & X_{1,~p} \\
    X_{2,~1} & \dots  & X_{2,~p} \\
    \vdots   & \ddots & \vdots   \\
    X_{n,~1} & \dots  & X_{n,~p}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
  \textbf{B}_{[p,~d]} ~=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    B_{1,~1} & \dots  & B_{1,~d} \\
    B_{2,~1} & \dots  & B_{2,~d} \\
    \vdots   & \ddots & \vdots   \\
    B_{p,~1} & \dots  & B_{p,~d}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

Let \emph{d = 2} for the sake of illustration.

Select a manip var, \emph{k}, and use the Gram-Schmidt process to
orthornormalize the concatenation of the zero vector with the
\emph{k}-th element set to 1, yielding the manipulation space,
\(\textbf{M}_{[p,~d+1]}\).

\begin{align*}
  \textbf{M}_{[p,~d+1]}
    &= Orthnormalize_{GS}( \textbf{B}_{[p,~d]}|\textbf{e}_{k~[p,~1]} ) \\
    &= Orthnormalize_{GS}
    \left(
      \begin{bmatrix}
        B_{1,~1} & B_{1,~2}\\
        B_{2,~1} & B_{2,~2}\\
        \vdots   & \vdots  \\
        B_{k,~1} & B_{k,~2}\\
        \vdots   & \vdots  \\
        B_{p,~1} & B_{p,~2}
      \end{bmatrix}
    ~|~
      \begin{bmatrix}
      0 \\
      0 \\
      \vdots \\
      1 \\
      \vdots \\
      0
      \end{bmatrix}
    \right)
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Select \(\theta\), angle of rotation with-in the plane of the XY
  projection, and a vector of \(\phi_i\), the angle of out-of plane
  rotation, orthagonal to the projection plane (relative to \(\phi_1\),
  the transformation \(\phi_i\) - \(\phi_1\) proved to be helpful to
  discuss \(\phi\) relative to the Z axis.)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For } \(i\) \textbf{in 1 to n\_slides:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For each \(\phi_i\), post multiplying
\end{itemize}

\(\textbf{M}_{[p, d+1]}\) by a rotation matrix,
\(\textbf{R}_{d+1, d+1}\) producing as many basis-projections,
\(\textbf{P}_{b[p, d+1]}\).

\begin{align}
  \textbf{P}_{b[p,~d+1]}
    &= \textbf{M}_{[p,~d+1]} ~*~ \textbf{R}_{[d+1,~d+1]}
    &= \begin{bmatrix}
        M_{1,~1} & M_{1,~2} & M_{1,~3} \\
        M_{2,~1} & M_{2,~2} & M_{2,~3} \\
        \vdots   & \vdots   & \vdots   \\
        M_{p,~1} & M_{p,~2} & M_{p,~3}
    \end{bmatrix}
      ~*~
    \begin{bmatrix}
      c_\theta^2 c_\phi s_\theta^2 &
      -c_\theta s_\theta (1 - c_\phi) &
      -c_\theta s_\phi \\
      -c_\theta s_\theta (1 - c_\phi) &
      s_\theta^2 c_\phi + c_\theta^2 &
      -s_\theta s_\phi \\
      c_\theta s_\phi &
      s_\theta s_\phi &
      c_\phi
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

where:

\begin{description}
  \item[$\theta$] is the angle that lies on the projection plane ($ie.$ on the XY plane)
  \item[$\phi$] is the angle orthagonal to the projection plane ($ie.$ in the Z direction)
  \item[$c_\theta$] is the cosine of $\theta$
  \item[$c_\phi$]   is the cosine of $\phi$
  \item[$s_\theta$] is the sine of   $\theta$
  \item[$s_\phi$]   is the sine of   $\phi$
\end{description}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To get back to data-space post multply each projection basis by the
  data, \(\textbf{X}_{[n x p]}\), for \(\textbf{P}_{d[n x d+1]}\).
\end{itemize}

\begin{align}
  \textbf{P}_{d[n,~d+1]}
    &= \textbf{X}_{[n,~p]} ~*~ \textbf{P}_{b[p,~d+1]}
    &= \begin{bmatrix}
      X_{1,~1} & \dots & X_{1,~p} \\
      X_{2,~1} & \dots & X_{2,~p} \\
      \vdots   & \vdots & \vdots  \\
      X_{n,~1} & \dots & X_{n,~p}
    \end{bmatrix}
      ~*~
    \begin{bmatrix}
      P_{b:1,~1} & P_{b:1,~2} & P_{b:1,~3} \\
      P_{b:2,~1} & P_{b:2,~2} & P_{b:2,~3} \\
      \vdots     & \vdots     & \vdots     \\
      P_{b:p,~1} & P_{b:p,~2} & P_{b:p,~3}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  View the first two variables from each projection in sequence for an
  XY scatterplot. The remaining variable is sometimes utilized to
  produce depth cues used in conjunction with the XY scatterplot.

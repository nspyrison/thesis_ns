# Conclusion {#ch-conclusion}

<!-- Context -->
We know that visualizing data is more robust than numerical summarization alone. It provides a means to rapidly get a feel for the data, check for erroneous values, and confirm model assumptions. But visualizing data spaces becomes increasingly complex as dimensionality increases. Linear dimension reduction and especially dynamic animations of linear projections, tours, seems to be a fruitful way to extend data visualization as dimensionality increases. Previously we have not had a means of testing the sensitivity of individual variables' contribution to the structure in one embedding. Chapter \@ref(ch-spinifex) introduced the __spinifex__ package, which facilitates user-controlled manual tours and layered composition and exporting animations of any tour, interoperably with __tourr__. Use of the radial, manual tour does sizably improve the accuracy on variable-level supervised cluster separation task compared with PCA and the grand tour. Chapter \@ref(ch-efficacy_radial_tour) covers the with-in participants user study that led to this conclusion. Finally, we extended the use of the manual tour to increase the interpretability of non-linear models by using it to explore their local explanations in the package __cheem__ is discussed in Chapter \@ref(ch-cheem).

<!-- user study -->
<!-- Chapter \ref{ch-efficacy_radial_tour} discussed a user study comparing the radial tour against PCA and the grand tour. Participants performed a variable attribution task of the supervised cluster separation. We define an accuracy measure for this task and the additional experimental factors location, shape, and dimensionality. I find strong evidence that use of the radial tour leads to high accuracy for this task. Using mixed model regression, I partition the error term of the model into the variation from participant's skill, and variation in difficult of the simulations due to random draws. -->

## Contributions
<!-- ## Software development -->

This study makes two major contributions to extending knowledge in the domain of data visualization.

<!-- spinifex -->
__C1__ The first contribution of this study is a software development package named __spinifex___. This package facilitates the preprocess transformations with `scale_*` functions, identifies features with `basis_*` functions, and allows user-control over variable contributions to the basis with manual tours. It creates a framework for layered creation of tour visuals with `proto_*` functions that will feel at home to __ggplot2__ users. A new key element of this package is the manual tours and those created from __tourr__ can be rendered and exported as interactive HTML widgets, .gif, or .mp4 files. Vignettes and interactive application help users rapidly understand the concepts and scope of the package. The impact of __spinifex__ can be seen in two ways. My contributions to it and __tourr__ won the ACEMS Impact and Engagement Award, 2018. Further, the package is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spinifex)  with vignettes and version notes on its [pkgdown](https://nspyrison.github.io/spinifex/) site. It has been downloaded over 14,400 times from CRAN between 09 April 2019 and 28 November 2021.

<!-- cheem -->
__C2__ The second contribution of the study is the __cheem__ package. I suggest using manual tours to extend the interpretability of black-box models by exploring their local explanations. A workflow is developed to facilitate the creation of a random forest model, calculating tree SHAP local explanations for each observation. An interactive application illustrates the purposed visual and analysis from several datasets or upload your data after processing. Local explanations are evaluated through testing the sensitivity of the variables to the structure identified in the explanation. __cheem__ was recently uploaded to [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cheem) and has a corresponding [pkgdown site](https://nspyrison.github.io/cheem/).


## Summary statement

Data visualization is crucial part of EDA and conveys more information than numeric summarization alone. Yet as the dimensionality of data space increases data visualization quickly becomes complex. At some point dimension reduction is going to become necessary for visualizing multivariate spaces. Data visualization tours are a class of the linear projections animated over small changes in the basis. The manual tour uniquely offer an analyst control over the contribution in the basis.

I have created a an open-source package that facilitates the creation of manual tours and layered display compositions of any tour path.


XXX TODO: write summary statement covering the broader impact of doing this work linked to chapter 1 intro. If we didn't have this work what would we be missing out on?

XXX TODO: Esp in the abstract blurb of the content chapters: make sure not to list out comes

XXX TODO do grep for use of the word paper and opt for study or chapter


## Future work

<!-- General tour extension -->
In addition to controlling the contribution of a single variable, it may be insightful to able to change contributions of several at once (manipulating on a linear combination). A sort of dimension reduction tour that would append several manual tours together, zeroing the contributions of variables one at a time may prove interesting in the vicinity of the a features intrinsic dimensionality.

<!-- spinifex --> 
There are direct natural extensions to __spinifex__, such as extending the type of protos available, such as adding a text table of the basis, convex hulls, alpha hulls, and a 'high density region' display where the bulk of the data is shown as density contour, while the outer most observations are displayed as points [@hyndman_computing_1996]. An additional interpolation of the manual tour could correlate the frame number with the magnitude of a radial tour; the first frame would contain zero magnitude, and the last contains a full contribution, while the default starting frame would  initial value.

<!-- 2.5d & XR -->
Experiencing tours as 3D scatterplots in extended reality with stereoscopically true head tracking may be fruitful. [@nelson_xgobi_1999] explore 2D tour is in virtual reality. Other works view 3D scatterplot tours on 2D displays [@yang_3d_1999; @yang_interactive_2000]. It would be interesting to see modern implementations using WebGL, Mozilla A-frame, or Unity. One concern would be trying to keep hardware and software as generalized as possible.

<!-- cheem -->
Similarly, __cheem__ analysis could be generalized to a broader range models and local explanations. The models and local explanations facilitated by `DALEX::explain()` seems to be a good starting point [@biecek_dalex_2018; @biecek_explanatory_2021]. Alternatively, there may be other statistics that better show the structure identified by explanations that could be added.

<!-- tour apps --> 
<!-- In addition to application that involve one tour variant such as the applications we have discussed or __liminal__ [@lee_casting_2020], a general more consolidated application with multiple linked brushing would be nice to have. There have been many takes on applications to facilitate the exploration of multivariate data and the audience that know of and uses tours remains small. Tour-based applications [@fisherkeller_prim-9:_1974; @swayne_xgobi:_1991; @hardle_xplore:_1995; @carr_explorn:_1996; @nelson_xgobi_1999; @sutherland_orca:_2000; @swayne_ggobi:_2003] and other multi-variate data visualization applications [@carr_explor4:_1988; @tierney_lisp-stat:_1990; @huh_davis:_2002; @wegman_visual_2003; @jeong_ipca:_2009, hadjar_webvr_2018; cordeil_iatk_2019]. -->

Data visualization is an important aspect of Exploratory Data Analysis. As the dimensionality of data increases so does the difficulty of visualizing them. Techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA). Traditional linear dimension reduction defines new components which are viewed as discrete pairs. Tours are a class of linear projections animating over continuous changes to the basis. I create an R package facilitating the manual tour and exporting of all tours. Then I prove the radial tour out performs PCA and the grand tour with an $n=108$ within-participant user study. Local explanations of a non-linear model approximate the variable importance within the vicinity of one observation. I create another R package to explore and evaluate the explanation by exploring its variable sensitivity to changes with the radial tour.

# Abstract {-}

Visualizing data space is crucial to exploratory data analysis, checking model assumptions, and validating model performance. Yet visualization quickly becomes complex as the dimensionality of the data or features increases. Traditionally, static, low-dimensional linear embeddings are used to mitigate this complexity. Such embedded space is a lossy approximation of the full space. However, viewing many embeddings with interactive supporting views improves the information conveyed. Data visualization _tours_ are a class of dynamic linear projections that animate many linear projections over small changes to the projection basis.

Tours are categorized by the path of their bases. _Manual tours_ allow for User-Controlled Steering (UCS) of bases path, where the contributions of individual variables can be controlled. I create a free, open-source __R__ package, __spinifex__, that facilitates creating such tours. These manipulations of the variables can be precomputed or made in real-time. Display composition and exportable formats are interoperable with the existing package __tourr__ and can be rendered with recent graphics interfaces __plotly__ and __gganimate__. The former offers interactive use with HTML widgets, while the latter can render to static formats such as .gif or .mp4 files. An interactive application is included to illustrate the use of the manual tour.

Theoretically, the UCS of the manual tour should enable an analyst to better explore the variable attribution to the structure identified in an embedding. I find strong evidence to support that radial tour leads to a significant and large increase in accuracy as compared with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and an alternative tour variant, the grand tour. I conduct a within-participant, crowdsourced user study comparing these visualization methods. Each of the $n=108$ participants performs two trials with each visual for 648 total trials. The task is a supervised classification problem asking participants which variables attribute to the separation of 2 clusters.

Modern modeling techniques are sometimes referred to as black-box models due to the uninterpretable nature of model terms which are often many and non-linear. Recent research in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tries to bring these
models interpretability through  _local explanations_. Local explanations are a class of techniques that approximate the linear-variable importance at one point in the data. I build an __cheem__, an __R__ package to streamline model and local explanation preprocessing, and two novel visuals. First the global view pits the data- and explanation-spaces side-by-side with a residual plot. Interactive features such as linked bushing and tooltips aid in identifying observations to compare. The local explanation from the selected observation becomes a basis used in creating the radial tour. This allows an analyst to evaluate the explanation by sensitivity of its variable contribution to the structure it has identified.

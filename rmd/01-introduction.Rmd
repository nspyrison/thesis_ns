# Introduction {#ch:introduction}

This thesis is related broadly to multivariate data visualization. That is visualizing an arbitrary $p-$dimensional space. First I discuss the context and scope before list the research objectives and methodology. Chapter \ref{ch:motivation} covers the motivation for such research. The research chapters 3 through 5 will cover their respective own backgrounds and follow-up discussion. Chapter \ref{ch:efficacy_radial_tour} dicusses a user study evaluating the efficacy of the radial, manual tour. Chapter \ref{ch:cheem} extends the use of manual tours to extend the interpretability of black-box models. Lastly Chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} concludes with some take-aways and discussion of possible extensions.

## Research objectives

Data and models are typically high-dimensional, with many variables and parameters. Developing new methods to visualize high dimensions has been a pursuit of statisticians, computer scientists and visualization researchers for decades. As technology evolves examining, extending, and assessing current techniques, in new environments, for new data challenges, is an important endeavor. The primary objectives of this Ph.D. research can then be summarized as the following.

**Research objectives (RO):**

1. **How can UCS be generalized to work within graphic-specific environments for 2D projections?**\
(Work in progress, chapter \ref{ch:workinprogress}.)\
Building from the UCS algorithm in @cook_manual_1997, the algorithm should be modified for generalized use with graphic-specific environments. This enables fine control to explore the sensitivity of structure to the variable contributing to the projection and sets the foundation to be used in the remaining objectives.

2. **Does 2D UCS tours provide benefits over alternatives?**\
(Future work, chapter \ref{ch:future_work}.)\
The quality and effectiveness of 2D UCS will be compared with alternatives of static, single, linear and non-linear projection techniques. They will be quantified by the measurement of structure, variation, and clustering across on benchmark datasets.

3. **How can UCS be extended to 3D?**\
(Future work, chapter \ref{ch:future_work}.)\
The addition of a 3rd dimension potentially allows for the improved perception of the structure of the data in dynamic UCS. To investigate this UCS algorithm needs to be extended to a third dimension. This would also allow for novel application multi-parameter function projection. This will involve the addition of a new angle and it controls to the projection space, reference axes, and manipulation space. In particular, the manipulation space, now in 4D, will be hard to visualize, but it should be able to stand as a mathematical construct facilitated through interaction with a point (the projection coefficients of the selected manipulation variable) on the now 3D reference axes volume. 

4. **Does UCS in 3D displays provide benefits over 2D displays?**\
(Future work, chapter \ref{ch:future_work}.)\
The addition of a 3rd dimension has previously been shown to provide benefits. The extension of UCS into 3D should be used to explore the potential benefits of UCS projections as well. Interactive, time-varying tours theoretically allow for improved understanding and comprehension speed of the structure of the data. These metrics will be measured across the display device (including a 2D standard monitor, 3D head tracked monitor, and 3D head-mounted display). 

**Contributions:**

The intended contributions and scope of this research can be summarized as:

1. A modified UCS algorithm and new implementation applied to contemporary high energy physics and astrophysics applications in 2D animation frameworks.
2. A performance comparison of static and interactive UCS projection techniques assessed on benchmark data sets from the recent literature.
3. A new algorithm for UCS in 3D. With new applications to function visualization in 3D.
4. Quantitative understanding of the relative benefits of UCS across 2- and 3D display devices.

## Methodology

This research is interdisciplinary; it stems from a linear dimension reduction technique developed by statisticians and extended with information technology into 3D including VR technologies, with applications in high energy physics identified[@cook_dynamical_2018]. Experts in these fields correspondingly supervise the research.

The research corresponding with RO #1 entails a work in progress **algorithm design** following the work in @cook_manual_1997. The proposed algorithm discusses the generalized application of UCS for use across animation-specific frameworks. The outcome of this is an *R* package, `spinifex`, which will be submitted to CRAN and for hosting and distribution. This forms the foundation for future work in the remaining objectives. 

The second objective is addressed with a benchmark dataset **performance comparison** between dynamic linear projections and alternatives (static linear and static non-linear projections such as principal component analysis, multi-dimensional scaling, and t-distributed neighbor embeddings, described in more detail in chapter \ref{ch:future_work}). Benchmark datasets will be compared across techniques, measurements will include variation explained, transparency to the original variable space, clustering identification, and outlier identification.

The research for RO #3 involves **algorithm design**, where the work in RO #1 will be extended to display with the use of a third spatial dimension. This will also be used to develop visualization of projected multi-dimension function surfaces. This forms the calculation base for the work. Several difficulties may arise when bringing dynamic projection into 3D spaces, especially when exploring 3D surfaces (discussed in more detail in chapter \ref{ch:future_work}).

The research resulting from RO #4 is a controlled **usability study** to explore the efficacy of bringing UCS into 3D as compared across various display devices, in a standardized interface allowed by the work stemming from RO # 3. In this design, the factors are user tasks (such as separation of clusters and ranking of manipulation variable) across the treatment of display device (including 2D standard monitor, 3D head-tracked monitor, and head-mounted display). Quantitative measurements include participant speed and accuracy of tasks, biometric readings, and subjective Likert surveys of participants. A lineup-type model as outlined in @hofmann_graphical_2012 may also be employed for assessing the quality of display types.


## Workflow and reproducibility 

Figure \@ref(fig:dataanalysisworkflow) depicts the general data analysis workflow [@wickham_r_2016]. Where data first must be imported into a tool, the structure of the data must be tidied and ordered neatly into the correct use format. After the data enters a repeating cycle, where values may be transformed, visualized, and modeled with communication going to the appropriate recipients. The research proposed in this document aids exploratory data analysis as well as the visualization aspect of this workflow. Mature analysis workflow is also made reproducible with the use of programmatic scripts.

```{r dataanalysisworkflow, echo=F, out.width='100%', fig.cap = "(ref:dataanalysisworkflow-cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/data_analysis_workflow.png")
```

The programing language, *R*, is used in the work described below to import, tidy, and transform data. It can be used directly to visualize 2D tours (RO #1 & 2) or be consumed into the game engine *Unity* to visualize 3D tours (RO #3 & 4). Doing analysis and writeup in such programmatic ways allow work to be done reproducibly. Where data, analysis, and code are stored in the same directory. Reproducible work facilitates validation, maintains transparency and minimizes the chance for human error. Reproduction of work is a key feature to validate and defend the claims and methodology held within a work. Directories of current and planned work are/will be hosted publicly on GitHub, including this report. Accessing the source files for this report is discussed in section \ref{sec:source}.

## Project overview {#ch:projectoverview}

Figure \@ref(fig:ProjectOverview) depicts a schematic flow chart that the research objectives will be executed in. The research stemming from RO #1, the application of 2D user-controlled steering (UCS), sets the foundation for which the other objectives can be researched. RO #3, the application of 3D UCS, must precede RO #4, as it explores the efficacy of 3D UCS across display devices. RO #2, the comparison of 2D UCS vs alternatives, must come after RO #1, but is of lower priority to RO #3 & 4, and so will be conducted last, in the event of a time crunch.

# Conclusion {#ch-conclusion}

<!-- Context -->
We know that visualizing data is more robust numerical summarization alone. It provides a means to rapidly get a feel for the data, check for erroneous values, and confirm model assumptions. But visualizing data spaces becomes increasingly complex as dimensionality increase. Linear dimension reduction and especially dynamic animations of linear projections, tours, seems to be a fruitful way to extend data visualization as dimensionality increases. Previous we haven't had a means of testing the sensitivity of individual variables contribution to the structure in one embedding. With the __spinifex__ package we create package facilitating manual tours. Then we explore the efficacy of the manual tour in a user study. Finally, we extended the use of the manual tour to the increase the interpretability of non-linear models by using it to explore their local explanations in the package __cheem__.

<!-- spinifex -->
In Chapter \ref{ch-spinifex} we discussed __spinifex__. How it facilitates the preprocess transformations with `scale_*` functions, identifies features with `basis_*` functions, and creates manual tours. It creates a framework for layered creation of tour visuals with `proto_*` functions that will feel at home to __ggplot2__ users. Manual tours and those created from __tourr__ can be rendered and exported as interactive HTML widgets, .gif, or .mp4 files. It has been downloaded over 14,400 times from CRAN between 09 April 2019 and 28 November 2021. my contributions __spinifex__ and __tourr__ won the ACEMS Impact and Engagement Award, 2018. 

<!-- user study -->
Chapter \ref{ch-efficacy_radial_tour} discussed a user study comparing the radial tour against PCA and the grand tour. Participants performed a variable attribution task of the supervised cluster separation. We define an accuracy measure for this task and the additional experimental factors location, shape, and dimensionality. I find strong evidence that use of the radial tour leads to high accuracy for this task. Using mixed model regression, I partition the error term of the model into the variation from participant's skill, and variation in difficult of the simulations due to random draws.

<!-- cheem -->
Now that we have evidence to support the radial tours use for variable attribution we extend their use to the further explore the local explanation of black-box models. Chapter \ref{ch-cheem} introduces an interactive global view that compares approximations of data- and attribution- spaces next to model performance. The explanations of selected observation from this global view are used as the initial basis for a radial tour to explore what support of variable contributions agree with the explanation view. Preprocessing functions as well as interactive application are provided in a free, open-source package __cheem__.


## Further extensions

<!-- spinifex -->
There are direct natural extension to __spinifex__ such as adding adding protos, such as adding a text table of the basis, 2D density contours, convex hulls, alpha hulls, and an 'high density region' display where the bulk of the data is shown as density contour, while the outer most observations are displayed as points [@hyndman_computing_1996].

<!-- cheem -->
Similarly, __cheem__ could be generalized to a broader range models and local explanations. The models and local explanations facilitated by `DALEX::explain()` seems to be a good starting point [@biecek_dalex_2018; biecek_explanatory_2021]. Alternatively there may be other statistics that better show the structure identified by explanations that could be added. 

<!-- 2.5d & XR -->
Experiencing tours as 3D scatterplots on 2D display, or in extended reality with steroscopically true head tracking may be fruitful. This has been partial explored [@nelson_xgobi_1998; yang_3d_1999; yang_interactive_2000], though it would be interesting see an modern implementations using WebGL, Mozilla A-frame, or Unity. One concern would be trying to keep hardware and software as generalized as possible.

<!-- tour app -->
In addition to application that involve one tour variant such as the applications we have discussed or __liminal__ [@lee_casting_2020], a general more consolidated application with multiple linked brushing would be nice to have. There have been many takes on applications to facilitate the exploration of multivariate data and the audience that know of and uses tours remains small. Tour-based applications [@fisherkeller_prim-9:_1974; @swayne_xgobi:_1991; @hardle_xplore:_1995; @carr_explorn:_1996; @nelson_xgobi_1998; @sutherland_orca:_2000; @swayne_ggobi:_2003] and other multi-variate data visualization applications [@carr_explor4:_1988; @tierney_lisp-stat:_1990; @huh_davis:_2002; @wegman_visual_2003; @jeong_ipca:_2009, hadjar_webvr_2018; cordeil_iatk_2019].


## Other contributions

In addition to the research discussed around the thesis of the manual and radial, manual tour other notable contributions during my candidature include:

- _The state-of-the-art on tours for dynamic visualization of high-dimensional data_ [@lee_state---art_2021], WIREs Computational Statistics. Review of current tour methods. I wrote the section discussing manual tours.
- _"Is IEEE VIS that good?" On key factors in the initial assessment of manuscript and venue quality_ [@spyrison_is_2021]. A survey IEEE VIS authors, how they source articles, decide which to read, and evaluate venue quality. We find low evidence that sentiment changes across academic positions for these topics and provide commentary and discussion on the effects of "publish or perish" environment, standard author and journal metrics, and the need to publish "null" findings and replication studies.
- _Intraday effect of COVID-19 restrictions on Melbourne electricity consumption_ [@barrow_changes_2020]. We corroborate that the Victorian interday effect on energy consumption did not change, and novelly find that the intraday distribution of energy consumption does change. Namely we find a statistically significant change in the height of the morning and evening peak energy consumption that we posit is due to less strict schedules associated with working from home, absence of commute time, or other employment changes. We were awarded 1st place of hundreds of entries in the insights category of the Melbourne 2020 Datathon.

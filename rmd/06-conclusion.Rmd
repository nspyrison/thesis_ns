# Conclusion {#ch:conclusion}


In Chapter \ref{ch:spinifex} we discussed __spinifex__. How its facilitate the preprocessing transformations with `scale_*` functions, identifies features with `basis_*` functions, and creates manual tours. It creates a framework for layered creation of tour visuals with `proto_*` fucntions that will feel at home to __ggplot2__ users. Manual tours and those created from __tourr__ can be rendered and exported as interactive HTML widgets, .gif or .mp4 files. It has been downloaded over 14400 times from CRAN between 09 April 2019 and 28 November 2021. my contributions __spinifex__ and __tourr__ won the ACEMS Impact and Engagement Award, 2018.

## Other contributions:
In addition to the research discussed around the central theme of the radial tour I have a number of other notable contributions including:

- _"Is IEEE VIS that good?" On key factors in the initial assessment of manuscript and venue quality_ [@spyrison_is_2021], A survey IEEE VIS authors, how they source articles, decide which to read, and evaluate venue quality. We find low evidence that sentiment changes with across acedemic position for these topics and provide commentary and discussion on the effects of "publish or perish" environment, standard author and journal metrics, and the need to publish "null finding" and replication studies.
- _Intraday effect of COVID-19 restrictions on Melbourne electricity consumption_ [@barrow_changes_2020], We corroborate that the Victorian interday effect on energy consumption did not change, and novely find that the intraday distribution of energy consumption does change. Namely we find a statistically significant change in the height of the morning and evening peak energy consumption. We were awarded 1st place of hundreds of entries in the insights category of the Melbourne 2020 Datathon.

# Conclusion {#ch-conclusion}

<!-- Context -->
We know that visualizing data is more robust than numerical summarization alone.  It provides a means to get a feel for the data rapidly, check for erroneous values, and confirm model assumptions. But visualizing data spaces becomes increasingly complex as dimensionality increases. Static linear dimension reduction has been popular in extending the space viewed. Dynamic animations of linear projections, tours, further increase the perceptible information of linearly reduced spaces. Previously we have not had a means to test the sensitivity of individual variables' contribution to the structure in one embedding. Chapter \@ref(ch-spinifex) introduced the __spinifex__ package, which facilitates user-controlled manual tours and layered composition and exporting animations of any tour, interoperably with __tourr__. The radial, manual tour does sizably improve the accuracy on variable-level supervised cluster separation task compared with PCA and the grand tour. Chapter \@ref(ch-userstudy) covers the within-participants user study that led to this conclusion. Finally, I extended use of the manual tour to increase the interpretability of non-linear models by using it to explore their local explanations in the package __cheem__ is discussed in Chapter \@ref(ch-cheem).

<!-- user study -->
<!-- Chapter \@ref(ch-userstudy) discussed a user study comparing the radial tour against PCA and the grand tour. Participants performed a variable attribution task of the supervised cluster separation. We define an accuracy measure for this task and the additional experimental factors location, shape, and dimensionality. I find strong evidence that use of the radial tour leads to high accuracy for this task. Using mixed model regression, I partition the error term of the model into the variation from participant's skill, and variation in difficult of the simulations due to random draws. -->

## Contributions
<!-- ## Software development -->

This study makes two major contributions to extending knowledge in the domain of data visualization.

<!-- spinifex -->
__C1__ The first contribution of this study is a software development package named __spinifex___. This package facilitates the preprocess transformations with `scale_*` functions, identifies features with `basis_*` functions, and allows an analyst to control variable contributions with manual tours. It creates a framework for layered creation of tour visuals with `proto_*` functions that will feel at home to __ggplot2__ users. A new key element of this package is the manual tours, and those created from __tourr__ can be rendered and exported as interactive HTML widgets, .gif, or .mp4 files. Vignettes and interactive application help users rapidly understand the concepts and scope of the package. The impact of __spinifex__ can be seen in two ways. My contributions to it and __tourr__ won the ACEMS Impact and Engagement Award, 2018. Further, the package is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spinifex)  with vignettes and version notes on its [pkgdown](https://nspyrison.github.io/spinifex/) site. It has been downloaded over 14,400 times from CRAN between 09 April 2019 and 28 November 2021.

<!-- cheem -->
__C2__ The second contribution of the study is the __cheem__ package. I suggest using manual tours to extend the interpretability of black-box models by exploring their local explanations. A workflow is developed to facilitate the creation of a random forest model, calculating tree SHAP local explanations for each observation. An interactive application illustrates the purposed visual and analysis from several datasets or upload your data after processing. Local explanations are evaluated by testing the variables' sensitivity to the structure identified in the explanation. __cheem__ was recently uploaded to [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cheem) and has a corresponding [pkgdown site](https://nspyrison.github.io/cheem/).


## Summary statement

Data visualization is crucial for EDA and conveys more information than numeric summarization alone. Yet as the dimensionality of data space increases, data visualization quickly becomes complex. At some point, dimension reduction will become necessary for visualizing multivariate spaces. Data visualization tours are a class of linear projections animated over small changes in the basis. The manual tour uniquely offers an analyst control over the contribution in the basis.

This thesis builds on the visualization of multivariate spaces and, particularly, user control affecting the variable contributions to linear bases. I have created a an open-source package that facilitates the creation of manual tours and layered display compositions of any tour path interoperably with existing packages. I conduct a user study showing strong support that giving analysts control with the radial tour leads to a sizable increase in variable attribution to the separation of two clusters. Lastly, I introduce a new analysis to extend black-box models' interpretability. This analysis explores the observation-specific variable attribution of local explanation of the model. By varying the contributions of these normalized attributions, we can explore the variable-level support of the explanations to see under what conditions they make sense and where they lack evidence. I create another open-source package to preprocess, visualize, and interactively perform this analysis.


## Future work

<!-- Manual tour extension -->
In addition to the manual tour controlling the contribution of a single variable, it may be insightful to be able to change the contributions of several variables at once (manipulating a linear combination). A sort of dimension reduction tour that would append several manual tours together, zeroing the contributions of variables one at a time may prove interesting as the number of embedded dimensions approaches a features intrinsic dimensionality.<!-- 3D and function vis -->Another future research topic could be to extend the algorithm for use on 3D tours. This would require applying another angle of rotation with Rodrigues' rotation formula on the current 3D rotation matrix. The addition of another display dimension may benefit the detection and understanding of the higher dimensional structure though the input of three angles may prove less natural and harder to capture.
<!-- Ink tank display --> The display order of the manual tour could be changed to more of an _ink tank_ display. Where the first frame would contain zero variable contribution and the last would have a full contribution, while the starting frame would be the original contribution.

<!-- 2.5d & XR -->
It may be interesting to experience tours as 3D scatterplots in extended reality with stereoscopically true head tracking may be fruitful. @nelson_xgobi_1999 explore 2D tour is in virtual reality. Other works view 3D scatterplot tours on 2D displays [@yang_3d_1999; @yang_interactive_2000]. It would be interesting to see modern implementations using WebGL, Mozilla A-frame, or Unity. One concern would be keeping hardware and software as generalized as possible.

<!-- Layered tour composition --> 
Putting aside the manual tour, there are a number of extensions to the layered composition of tours in __spinifex__, such as extending the type of protos available, such as adding a text table of the basis, convex hulls, alpha hulls, and a 'high density region' display where the bulk of the data is shown as density contour, while the outermost observations are displayed as points [@hyndman_computing_1996]. 

<!-- cheem -->
Similarly, __cheem__ analysis could be generalized to a broader range of models and local explanations.  The models and local explanations facilitated by `DALEX::explain()` seems to be a good direction to extend [@biecek_dalex_2018; @biecek_explanatory_2021]. Alternatively, other statistics may better show the structure identified by explanations that could be added.

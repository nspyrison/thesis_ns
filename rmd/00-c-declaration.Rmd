# Declaration {-}

I hereby declare that this thesis contains no material which has been accepted for the award of any other degree or diploma at any university or equivalent institution and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this thesis contains no material previously published or written by another person, except where due reference is made in the text of the thesis.


## Publication as part of this thesis {-}

The work corresponding to Chapter \@ref(ch-spinifex) has been accepted for publication in _The R Journal_ [@spyrison_spinifex_2020]. While respective studies discussed in Chapters \@ref(ch-userstudy) and \@ref(ch-cheem) have not yet been submitted.

I have renumbered and updated sections of the published paper to generate a consistent presentation within the thesis. The code illustrated has been adjusted to highlight the new ggproto API. Introductory and background content has been moved to their respective thesis chapters.
 

## Publications and papers during candidature not part of this thesis {-}

In addition to the research discussed in the thesis, other notable contributions during my candidature include:

- _The state-of-the-art on tours for dynamic visualization of high-dimensional data_ [@lee_state_2021]. A WIREs Computational Statistics Review of current tour methods. I contributed the writing and visuals discussing manual tours.
- _"Is IEEE VIS that good?" On key factors in the initial assessment of manuscript and venue quality_ [@spyrison_is_2021]. This alt.VIS workshop paper covers a survey of IEEE VIS authors, how they source articles, decide which to read, and evaluate venue quality. There is low evidence that sentiment changes across academic positions for these topics and provided a discussion on the effects of the "publish or perish" environment, standard author and journal metrics, and difficulty in publishing "null" findings and replication studies.
- _Intraday effect of COVID-19 restrictions on Melbourne electricity consumption_ [@barrow_changes_2020]. In this Melbourne Datathon entry, we corroborate that the Victorian interday effect on energy consumption did not change but novelly find that the _intraday_ distribution of energy consumption does change. There is a statistically significant change in the height between the morning and evening peak energy consumption. We posit this is due to less strict schedules associated with working from home, absence of commute time, and other employment changes. This work was awarded 1st place of hundreds of entries in the insights category of the Melbourne 2020 Datathon.

All of the papers in the thesis were conceptualized, developed, and written by myself, the student, while working in the Department of Human-Centered Computing under the supervision of Professor Kimbal Marriott and Professor Dianne Cook. When co-authors are listed, it indicates that the work was produced through active collaboration between researchers and that their contributions to team-based research have been recognized. The following table details the work, including my and my fellow co-authors' contributions.

# Introduction {#ch:introduction}

## Exploratory data analysis

The term exploratory data analysis was coined in @tukey_exploratory_1977. Tukey does not specify specific processes and uses the term to encompass more broad aspects to initial summarization and visualization. This is the first conceptualization of the structure of the data and should validate assumptions made by prospective methodology. Visualization is crucial to a clear understanding of the data. Things can go awry when data is summarized via numeric statistics alone [@anscombe_graphs_1973], demonstrated in figure \@ref(fig:matejka17fig) [@matejka_same_2017]. In these studies, bivariate data have the same summary statistics, such as mean and standard deviation, yet contain obvious visual trends and shapes that could go completely unheeded if graphing the data is foregone. Because there are inherent dangers to relying on statistics alone, this requirement for looking at visuals necessitates *human-in-the-loop* analysis, defined as a model that requires human interaction.


(ref:matejka17fig-cap) 12 data sets created from the datasaurus by simulated annealing. Each is restrained to the same summary statistics but given shapes with visual peculiarity to mutate into [@matejka_same_2017].

```

It is clear that data-space visualization is needed but becomes complex as data dimensionality increases. Embedding (or projecting) $p-$dimensional data on to a lower, $d$-dimensional subspace is a common dimension reduction approach to visualize multivariate data spaces. Traditionally a single static projection is used to summarize a space, which necessarily shows a subset of the variation of the data. @asimov_grand_1985 suggested the use of viewing projections dynamically across a changing projection basis allows for more variation to be contained and viewed temporally. This dynamic view of many changing projections is known as *tours*. While, there are different methods of generating tour paths, human-in-the-loop user-controlled steering (UCS) offers the finest control for navigating local structure and is particularly useful in exploration after an interesting feature has been identified. 

Tours commonly view $d=\{1, 2, 3\}$ embedded subspaces from standard 2D monitors, and most commonly viewed as a projection down to $d=2$. The exception being @nelson_xgobi_1998, where $d=3$ tours were viewed in 3D head-tracked VR. Data visualization studies generally show an improved perception of 3D visuals over 2D, especially when adequate depth cues are provided. The state of modern hardware improvements has made VR more affordable and available to wider audiences, at ever increasing resolutions of display than previously possible. Research should be conducted to compare the perception of dynamic linear projections across display type. 

 
## Research objectives

Data and models are typically high-dimensional, with many variables or parameters. Developing new methods to visualize high dimensions has been a pursuit of statisticians, computer scientists and visualization researchers for decades. As technology evolves examining, extending, and assessing current techniques, in new environments, for new data challenges, is an important endeavor. The primary goal of this Ph.D. research can then be summarized as:

**Research objectives (RO):**

1. **How can UCS be implemented in 1- and 2D projections?** (Work in progress, chapter \ref{ch:workinprogress}.) 
Following the theory laid out in @cook_manual_1997, a new UCS algorithm is devised for use in animation specific implementations. This enables fine control of exploring the local structure of data in 2D embeddings, setting a framework to be used in the remaining objectives.
2. **Does 2D UCS provide benefits over alternatives?** (Future work, chapter \ref{ch:future_work}.) 
The quality and effectiveness of the dynamic UCS will be compared to benchmark datasets against commonly used alternatives of static, single, linear and non-linear projection techniques. The addition of the temporal dimension theoretically allows for more information to be conveyed than in static projections.
3. **How can UCS be extended to 3D?** (Future work, chapter \ref{ch:future_work}.) The UCS algorithm needs to be extended to arbitrary, or at least, a third dimension and the rendering of 3D tours for use across mixed reality display devices. This involves communication between programming languages and allows for the comparison across display devices.
4. **Does UCS in 3D displays provide perception benefits over 2D displays?** (Future work, chapter \ref{ch:future_work}.)The addition of a stereoscopic 3rd dimension has previously shown improved perception. Building on the work from the previous objective the efficacy of 3D tours should be explored using modern hardware across display devices. 


## Methodology

This research is interdisciplinary; it's base on a dimension reduction technique developed by statisticians, extended with information technology into 3D including VR technologies, with applications in high energy physics identified[@cook_dynamical_2018]. The research is correspondingly supervised experts in these fields.

The research corresponding with RO #1 entails a work in progress **algorithm design** following the work in @cook_manual_1997 to allow for UCS. The proposed algorithm discusses the generalized application of UCS for use across animation implementations. This outcome of this is an *R* package, `spinifex`, which will be submitted to CRAN and for hosting and distribution. This forms the foundation for future work in the remaining objectives. 

The second objective is addressed with a benchmark dataset comparison **case study** between dynamic linear projections and alternatives (static linear and static non-linear projections such as Principal Component Analysis, Multi-Dimensional Scaling, and t-distributed neighbor embeddings, described in more detail in chapter \ref{ch:future_work}). Benchmark datasets will be compared across techniques, measurements will include variation explained, transparency to the original variable space, clustering, and outlier identification.

The research for RO #3 involves **algorithm design**, where the work in RO #1 will be extended to the third dimension, if not arbitrary dimensions. Surface and function projections will also be developed. This forms the calculation base for the work. After the projections have been produced, they will be used consumed by the immersive analytics toolkit (IATK) [@cordeil_immersive_2019], an extensible toolkit for visualizing data in VR. This standardized interface across display devices.

The research resulting from RO #4 is a controlled **usability study** to explore the efficacy of bringing UCS into 3D as compared across various display devices. In this design, every participant will complete every task on every display device. Display device is the design variable with task type as the covariate. Quantitative measurements include participant speed and accuracy of tasks, biometric readings, and subjective Likert surveys of participants. A lineup-type model as outlined in @hofmann_graphical_2012 may also be employed for assessing the quality of display types.


## Workflow and reproducibility 

Figure \@ref(fig:dataanalysisworkflow) depicts the general data analysis workflow [@wickham_r_2016]. Where data first must be imported into a tool, the structure of the data must be tidied and ordered neatly into the correct use format. After the data enters a repeating cycle, where values may be transformed, visualized, and modeled with communication going to the appropriate recipients. The research proposed in this document aids exploratory data analysis as well as the visualization aspect of this workflow. Mature analysis workflow is also made reproducible with the use of programmatic scripts.

```

The programing language, *R*, is used in the work described below to import, tidy, and transform data. It can be used directly to visualize 2D tour (RO #1 & 2) or be consumed into the game engine *Unity* to visualize 3D tours (RO #3 & 4). Doing analysis and writeup in such programmatic ways allow work to be done reproducibly. Where data, analysis, and code are stored in the same directory. Reproducible work facilitates validation, maintains transparency and minimizes the chance for human error. Reproduction of work is a key feature to validate and defend the claims and methodology held within a work. Directories of current and planned work are/will be hosted publicly on GitHub, including this report. Accessing the source files for this report is discussed in section \ref{sec:source}.

## Project overview {#ch:projectoverview}

The research gaps in the literature review leave room for the research objectives outlined in the introduction. Figure \@ref(fig:ProjectOverview) depicts a schematic flow chart that the research objectives will be executed in. The research responding to RO #1, the application of 2D user-controlled steering (UCS), sets the foundation for which the other objectives can be researched. RO #3, the application of 3D UCS, must precede RO #4, exploring the efficacy of 3D UCS across display devices. RO #2, the comparison of 2D UCS vs alternatives, must come after RO #1, but is of lower priority to RO #3 & 4, and so will be conducted last, in the event of a time crunch.

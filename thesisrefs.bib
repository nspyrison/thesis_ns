	abstract     = {At 11.59pm on March 30 2020, the Australian and Victorian Government enacted Stage 3 movement and economic restrictions on Victorian residents in response to outbreaks of of the novel cororonavirus (COVID-19). Whilst many of these restrictions were repealed in May and June, the Victorian Government re-imposed Stage 3 restrictions on 11.59pm on 1 July 2020. Stricter Stage 4 restrictions were decreed on the afternoon of 2 August 2020 and enacted immediately. Using aggregated electricity demand data for Victoria from January 2015 to September 2020, we find that neither the Stage 3 restrictions imposed on 30 March, nor the marginal shift to Stage 4 restrictions on 2 August, caused average half-hourly(DAILY MEDIAN?) electricity consumption to materially change. However, we find that statistically significant changes to intraday seasonality took place when movement restrictions were imposed. In particular, we find that the effect of initially transitioning to Stage 3 restrictions in late March was stronger than the marginal effect of moving to stricter Stage 4 restrictions in August.}

Using a screen input device such as a mouse, the analyst can specify, in a visual way, points or regions on the display and cause aspects of the display to change nearly instantaneously. Brushing is a collection of dynamic methods for viewing multidimensional data. It is very effective when used on a scatterplot matrix, a rectangular array of all pairwise scatterplots of the variables. Four brushing operations—highlight, shadow highlight, delete, and label—are carried out by moving a mouse-controlled rectangle, called the brush, over one of the scatterplots. The effect of an operation appears simultaneously on all scatterplots. Three paint modes—transient, lasting, and undo—and the ability to change the shape of the brush allow the analyst to specify collections of points on which the operations are carried out. Brushing can be used in various ways or on certain types of data; these usages are called brush techniques and include the following: single-point and cluster linking, conditioning on a single variable, conditioning on two variables, subsetting with categorical variables, and stationarity probing of a time series.},

It is the lack of tools for model exploration (extraction of relationships learned by the model), model explanation (understanding the key factors influencing model decisions) and model examination (identification of model weaknesses and evaluation of model's performance). This book presents a collection of model agnostic methods that may be used for any black-box model together with real-world applications to classification and regression problems.},

It now makes substantial contributions within computer science as well, as part of the growing ?elds of information visualization and data mining, especially visual data mining. The material in this book includes: • An introduction to data visualization, explaining how it di?ers from other types of visualization. • Adescriptionofourtoolboxofinteractiveanddynamicgraphicalmethods. • An approach for exploring missing values in data. • An explanation of the use of these tools in cluster analysis and supervised classi?cation. • An overview of additional material available on the web. • A description of the data used in the analyses and exercises.

	abstract     = {Projection pursuit describes a procedure for searching high-dimensional data for “interesting” low-dimensional projections via the optimization of a criterion function called the projection pursuit index. By empirically examining the optimization process for several projection pursuit indexes, we observed differences in the types of structure that maximized each index. We were especially curious about differences between two indexes based on expansions in terms of orthogonal polynomials, the Legendre index, and the Hermite index. Being fast to compute, these indexes are ideally suited for dynamic graphics implementations. Both Legendre and Hermite indexes are weighted L 2 distances between the density of the projected data and a standard normal density. A general form for this type of index is introduced that encompasses both indexes. The form clarifies the effects of the weight function on the index's sensitivity to differences from normality, highlighting some conceptual problems with the Legendre and Hermite indexes. A new index, called the Natural Hermite index, which alleviates some of these problems, is introduced. A polynomial expansion of the data density reduces the form of the index to a sum of squares of the coefficients used in the expansion. This drew our attention to examining these coefficients as indexes in their own right. We found that the first two coefficients, and the lowest-order indexes produced by them, are the most useful ones for practical data exploration because they respond to structure that can be analytically identified, and because they have “long-sighted” vision that enables them to “see” large structure from a distance. Complementing this low-order behavior, the higher-order indexes are “short-sighted.” They are able to see intricate structure, but only when they are close to it. We also show some practical use of projection pursuit using the polynomial indexes, including a discovery of previously unseen structure in a set of telephone usage data, and two cautionary examples which illustrate that structure found is not always meaningful.}

Projections can easily display aspects of structure that are only of low dimension, and sections–that is, intersections of subspaces with a high-dimensional object–can easily display structure of only low codimension (and hence often high dimension). However, compositions of sections and projections, here called prosections, can display aspects of structure of any intermediate dimension. These statements are relevant for data analysis: projections of data can be easily generated with x-y scatterplots, three-dimensional (3-D) data rotations, and grand tours; sections can be approximated in existing systems by scatterplot brushing and painting. Thus this article is in part an investigation into the principles underlying these techniques.}

Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.}

In this article, a way to demonstrate the underlying superiority of three-dimensional, with respect to two-dimensional, representation is proposed. Specifically, it is based on the inevitable quality degradation produced when reducing the data dimensionality. The problem is tackled from two different approaches: a visual and an analytical approach. First, a set of statistical tests (point classification, distance perception, and outlier identification) using the two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualization are carried out on a group of 40 users. The results indicate that there is an improvement in the accuracy introduced by the inclusion of a third dimension; however, these results do not allow to obtain definitive conclusions on the superiority of three-dimensional representation. Therefore, in order to draw further conclusions, a deeper study based on an analytical approach is proposed. The aim is to quantify the real loss of quality produced when the data are visualized in two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces, in relation to the original data dimensionality, to analyze the difference between them. To achieve this, a recently proposed methodology is used. The results obtained by the analytical approach reported that the loss of quality reaches significantly high values only when switching from three-dimensional to two-dimensional representation. The considerable quality degradation suffered in the two-dimensional visualization strongly suggests the suitability of the third dimension to visualize data.}

With DAVIS we can dynamically explore the structure of data by mouse brushing a portion of the data on any of the above mentioned visualization tools. We can focus, delete or identify the brushed data points, and dynamically link the result to the other visualization tools. DAVIS also enables us to visually investigate the result of mathematical clustering methods by propagating the result of classification to the visualization tools in real time.},

Three-dimensional point cloud rotations provide the canonical example of the applications of motion graphics to data analysis. Similarly, motion may be used to good effect to explore data of arbitrarily high dimension. This will be demonstrated by describing how a data analyst guides a projection plane as it moves through high-dimensional data space.}

Most indexes have been developed to detect departure from known distributions, such as normality, or to find separations between known groups. Here, we are interested in finding projections revealing potentially complex bivariate patterns, using new indexes constructed from scagnostics and a maximum information coefficient, with a purpose to detect unusual relationships between model parameters describing physics phenomena. The performance of these indexes is examined with respect to ideal behaviour, using simulated data, and then applied to problems from gravitational wave astronomy. The implementation builds upon the projection pursuit tools available in the R package, tourr, with indexes constructed from code in the R packages, scagnostics, minerva and mbgraphic.},

Very few projection pursuit indices incorporate class or group information in the calculation. Hence, they cannot be adequately applied in supervised classification problems to provide low-dimensional projections revealing class differences in the data. This article introduces new indices derived from linear discriminant analysis that can be used for exploratory supervised classification.},

Projection pursuit for classiﬁcation ﬁnds projections that reveal differences between classes. Even though projection pursuit is used to bypass the curse of dimensionality, most indexes will not work well when there are a small number of observations relative to the number of variables, known as a large p (dimension) small n (sample size) problem. This paper discusses the relationship between the sample size and dimensionality on classiﬁcation and proposes a new projection pursuit index that overcomes the problem of small sample size for exploratory classiﬁcation.}

Our technique varies from previous approaches in that new datasets are iteratively generated from a seed dataset through random perturbations of individual data points, and can be directed towards a desired outcome through a simulated annealing optimization strategy. Our method has the beneﬁt of being agnostic to the particular statistical properties that are to remain constant between the datasets, and allows for control over the graphical appearance of resulting output.}

This paper describes an experiment conducted to determine if the new technology provides an improved exploratory data analysis environment over traditional workstation graphics environments, such as XGobi. A good analogy comparing the di erence between the two environments is that one is like a desk and the other like a room. The visualization tasks we compare between the two environments are detecting clusters, dimensionality and radial sparseness in high-dimensional data, and we also compare the ease of interaction between the computer and human user in the two environments.}

	abstract     = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

To motivate discussion, requirements for the visualization of abstract data are reviewed and then related to the properties of immersive environments in order to show its potential for data visualization. This leads to the introduction of a novel concept for immersive visualization based on the involvement of the viewers into the data display. The usefulness of the concept is shown by two examples demonstrating that immersive environments are far more than tools to create visually appealing data representations.},

	abstract     = {Dynamic low-dimensional linear projections of multivariate data collectively known as tours provide an important tool for exploring multivariate data and models. The R package tourr provides functions for several types of tours: grand, guided, little, local and frozen. Each of these can be viewed dynamically, or saved into a data object for animation. This paper describes a new package, spinifex, which provides a manual tour of multivariate data where the projection coefï¬cient of a single variable is controlled. The variable is rotated fully into the projection, or completely out of the projection. The resulting sequence of projections can be displayed as an animation, with functions from either the plotly or gganimate packages. By varying the coefï¬cient of a single variable, it is possible to explore the sensitivity of structure in the projection to that variable. This is particularly useful when used with a projection pursuit guided tour to simplify and understand the solution. The use of the manual tour is applied particle physics data to illustrate the sensitivity of structure in a projection to speciï¬c variable contributions.}

The data views are designed for data that have a multivariate component. The approach to displaying data comes from earlier research on building statistical graphics based on data pipelines, in which different aspects of data processing and graphical rendering are organized conceptually into segments of a pipeline. The software design takes advantage of the object-oriented nature of the Java language to open up the data pipeline, allowing developers to have greater control over their visualization applications. Importantly, new types of data views coded to adhere to a few simple design requirements can easily be integrated with existing pipe sections. This allows access to sophisticated linking and dynamic interaction across all (new and existing) view types. Pipe segments can be accessed from data analysis packages such as Omegahat or R, providing a tight coupling of visual and numerical methods.},

In this work, we evaluate the use of an HMD-based environment for the exploration of multidimensional data, represented in 3D scatterplots as a result of dimensionality reduction (DR). We present a new modeling for this problem, accounting for the two factors whose interplay deter- mine the impact on the overall task performance: the difference in errors introduced by performing dimensionality reduction to 2D or 3D, and the difference in human perception errors under different visualization conditions. This two-step framework offers a simple approach to estimate the benefits of using an immersive 3D setup for a particular dataset. Here, the DR errors for a series of roll call voting datasets when using two or three dimensions are evaluated through an empirical task-based approach. The perception error and overall task performance, on the other hand, are assessed through a comparative user study with 30 participants. Results indicated that perception errors were low and similar in all approaches, resulting in overall performance benefits in both desktop and HMD-based 3D techniques. The immersive condition, however, was found to require less effort to find information and less navigation, besides providing much larger subjective perception of accuracy and engagement.}

The collection of two-planes in a d-dimensional space is called a Grassmannian manifold. A key feature of the grand tour is that the projection planes are chosen according to a dense, continuous path through the Grassmannian manifold which yields the visual impression of points moving continuously.},

	abstract     = {SummaryIn this paper, we present some graphical techniques for cluster analysis of high-dimensional data. Parallel coordinate plots and parallel coordinate density plots are graphical techniques which map multivariate data into a two-dimensional display. The method has some elegant duality properties with ordinary Cartesian plots so that higher-dimensional mathematical structures can be analyzed. Our high interaction software allows for rapid editing of data to remove outliers and isolate clusters by brushing. Our brushing techniques allow not only for hue adjustment, but also for saturation adjustment. Saturation adjustment allows for the handling of comparatively massive data sets by using the α-channel of the Silicon Graphics workstation to compensate for heavy overplotting.The grand tour is a generalized rotation of coordinate axes in a high-dimensional space. Coupled with the full-dimensional plots allowed by the parallel coordinate display, these techniques allow the data analyst to explore data which is both high-dimensional and massive in size. In this paper we give a description of both techniques and illustrate their use to do inverse regression and clustering. We have used these techniques to analyze data on the order of 250,000 observations in 8 dimensions. Because the analysis requires the use of color graphics, in the present paper we illustrate the methods with a more modest data set of 3848 observations. Other illustrations are available on our web page.},

However, data mining strategies are often applied to massive data sets where visualization may not be very successful because of the limits of both screen resolution, human visual system resolution as well as the limits of available computational resources. In this paper I suggest some strategies for overcoming such limitations and illustrate visual data mining with some examples of successful attacks on high-dimensional and large data sets.

The projected data can be rendered as densities or histograms, scatterplots, anaglyphs, glyphs, scatterplot matrices, parallel coordinate plots, time series or images, and viewed using an R graphics device, passed to GGobi, or saved to disk. A tour path can be stored for visualisation or replay. With this package it is possible to quickly experiment with diﬀerent, and new, approaches to tours of data.

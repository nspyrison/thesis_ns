This paper proposes three strategies for visualizing statistical models: (1) display the model in the data space, (2) look at all members of a collection, and (3) explore the process of model ﬁtting, not just the end result. Each strategy is accompanied by examples, including manova, classiﬁcation algorithms, hierarchical clustering, ensembles of linear models, projection pursuit, self organizing maps and neural networks.},

Projections can easily display aspects of structure that are only of low dimension, and sections–that is, intersections of subspaces with a high-dimensional object–can easily display structure of only low codimension (and hence often high dimension). However, compositions of sections and projections, here called prosections, can display aspects of structure of any intermediate dimension. These statements are relevant for data analysis: projections of data can be easily generated with x-y scatterplots, three-dimensional (3-D) data rotations, and grand tours; sections can be approximated in existing systems by scatterplot brushing and painting. Thus this article is in part an investigation into the principles underlying these techniques.},

This paper describes an experiment conducted to determine if the new technology provides an improved exploratory data analysis environment over traditional workstation graphics environments, such as XGobi. A good analogy comparing the di erence between the two environments is that one is like a desk and the other like a room. The visualization tasks we compare between the two environments are detecting clusters, dimensionality and radial sparseness in high-dimensional data, and we also compare the ease of interaction between the computer and human user in the two environments.},

The package includes functions for creating diﬀerent types of tours, including grand, guided, and little tours, which project multivariate data (p-D) down to 1, 2, 3, or, more generally, d (≤ p) dimensions. The projected data can be rendered as densities or histograms, scatterplots, anaglyphs, glyphs, scatterplot matrices, parallel coordinate plots, time series or images, and viewed using an R graphics device, passed to GGobi, or saved to disk. A tour path can be stored for visualisation or replay. With this package it is possible to quickly experiment with diﬀerent, and new, approaches to tours of data. This paper contains animations that can be viewed using the Adobe Acrobat PDF viewer.},

	abstract = {SummaryIn this paper, we present some graphical techniques for cluster analysis of high-dimensional data. Parallel coordinate plots and parallel coordinate density plots are graphical techniques which map multivariate data into a two-dimensional display. The method has some elegant duality properties with ordinary Cartesian plots so that higher-dimensional mathematical structures can be analyzed. Our high interaction software allows for rapid editing of data to remove outliers and isolate clusters by brushing. Our brushing techniques allow not only for hue adjustment, but also for saturation adjustment. Saturation adjustment allows for the handling of comparatively massive data sets by using the α-channel of the Silicon Graphics workstation to compensate for heavy overplotting.The grand tour is a generalized rotation of coordinate axes in a high-dimensional space. Coupled with the full-dimensional plots allowed by the parallel coordinate display, these techniques allow the data analyst to explore data which is both high-dimensional and massive in size. In this paper we give a description of both techniques and illustrate their use to do inverse regression and clustering. We have used these techniques to analyze data on the order of 250,000 observations in 8 dimensions. Because the analysis requires the use of color graphics, in the present paper we illustrate the methods with a more modest data set of 3848 observations. Other illustrations are available on our web page.},

However, data mining strategies are often applied to massive data sets where visualization may not be very successful because of the limits of both screen resolution, human visual system resolution as well as the limits of available computational resources.

Traditional grids of scatterplots often obscure important features of the data when one or more variables are categorical but coded as numerical. The generalized pairs plot oﬀers a range of displays of paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. A mosaic plot, ﬂuctuation diagram, or facetted bar chart may be used to display two categorical variables. A side-byside boxplot, stripplot, facetted histogram, or density plot helps visualize a categorical and a quantitative variable. A traditional scatterplot is suitable for displaying a pair of numerical variables, but options also support density contours or annotating summary statistics such as the correlation and number of missing values, for example. Two diﬀerent packages provide implementations of the generalized pairs plot, gpairs and GGally. The use of the generalized pairs plot may reveal structure in multivariate data which otherwise might go unnoticed in the process of exploratory data analysis.

## Requirements

You will need to install `spinifex` to run Nick's thesis:

```r
devtools::install_github("nspyrison/spinifex")

To set up the software, you will need to install the `bookdown` package and its dependencies as follows:

You will also need LaTeX installed. If you don't already have LaTeX, one convenient approach is to install it via R:

install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
